 Never in a million years would I have predicted that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker would be the best character in this movie 
" Kevin Feige finally realized they’re never going to do a villain as good as Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin and just went “fuck it, bring him back” "
" the whole theatre ERUPTED, ya’ll know when.i cant breathe this was absolutely phenomenal best film of the year. i WEPT when andrew saved MJ and was talking about gwen. i swear to god i’m not okay. "
" Marvel is so good at getting people to do things for money in a way that reads like love. there's some very cutesy stuff here (most of it an ominous, logical continuation of the content snake eating its own tail), CGI New York City is a really a Character Unto Itself lolol, and Jon Watts is now unquestionably the worst director to ever make a Spider-Man movie. also, not a spoiler, lol at Pete and his friends for simply *assuming* they'd all get into MIT. a very cool premise for a $250 million movie. "
 Imagine how cool this would have been if the internet wasn’t the way it is 
 my favorite part was when the whole theater suddenly cried out “WE WANT KIRSTEN DUNST! WE WANT KIRSTEN DUNST!” in complete unison 
 I wanted a Spider-Man orgy and didn’t get it 
 Easily the best Marvel movie since Eternals. 
 doctor strange: these villains must be stopped peter parker: i could fix them 
" Spoiler Alert:This was maybe the greatest cinematic experience I have ever had. Not only were the shots surprisingly good for a marvel movie, but every line of comedy hit and the action was dope. When Tobey and Andrew showed up the whole theatre went absolutely insane. This was an Endgame level movie. "
 bruh when the green teletubbie carried tobey to his grave that shit got me😔 
" SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME swings for the fences with the most ambitious live-action Spider-Man film yet. The execution can be a bit messy due to the overabundance of villains & CGI (most of which we’ve seen done in previous films before) but the stirring highs are worth it. Features Tom Holland’s most emotional & best performance to date. Out of all the villains, Willem Dafoe once again steals the show as the sinister Green Goblin. What a treat it was getting to see him reprising this iconic adversary nearly twenty years later. "
" my theater starting hooting and hollering and going apeshit when tom holland showed up, absolutely no one was expecting him to cameo in this "
" damn, now there’s no MAY home! "
" If you told me Willem Dafoe flies around and terrorizes the people of New York in real life, I’d believe you… "
 Andrew Garfield is one of my favorite actors to watch he’s literally one of the most committed actors ever born he’s so funny made me laugh a lot herealso side note: the dr strange preview looked cool but it’s so crazy how much marvel stuff there is hm do we think I can get a job there - my apartment is bad 😭

" It was a bizarre, somewhat surreal moment when the other spider-men came in that i felt like i was watching some badly fan-edited/tiktok video. Tobey looked like he didn’t want to be there half the time and i love him for it.

"  What’s wrong with the previous Holland movies that isn’t wrong with this one? Did you just need to hear someone say “with great power comes great responsibility” and then die? It’s not like in this instance it’s even the consequence of a character flaw/shortcoming for Peter grow out of. You could argue it motivates vengeance, but this just leads to flip-flopping character motivation where Peter only spends about 5 minutes total set on killing Osborn before being easily talked out…  "
"  Although the gimmickry is fun from front to back, the ultimate key to the movie's success is its refusal to rest on the easy laurels of those gimmicks. The nostalgic joy of familiar faces is made resonant by the power of Aunt May's shocking death, of villains capable of both goodwill and destruction, of three perfectly unique webslingers bonding over grief, of Garfield's Spider-Man so poignantly stopping MJ's fall, and of an ending that follows ""depression is rage turned inward""…  "

"  Seeing all the Raimi characters here really showed off how ugly this movie was. Those films are visual marvels inventing the genre in a way we can barely remember. Andrew Garfield is such a fantastic actor. Beautiful to see him redeemed here!

So at times the thrill of…  "
"  Screenplays don’t come up much when we discuss superhero movies, but Spider-Man: No Way Home reminds us that they’re as crucial as casting and special effects. After their smart, high school-centric scripts for Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, both starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers are faced with a daunting task: maintain the small-scale, adolescent intimacy they’ve established while also serving up a metaversal, multi-character narrative that draws from the pre-Holland feature films…  "

"  From Murdock to the reunion, No Way Home accomplishes what it set out to do and it deserves a lot of credit for delivering on the hype. It’s leaps and bounds better than Homecoming and Far From Home and does an excellent job giving Tom Holland’s Spidey some depth. With all that said, it’s easy to get consumed by the sheer excitement, fan service and cameos that one can be blind to some of the more obvious issues present in…  "

" Andrew Garfield bringing his theatre kid energy to the MCU is a real highlight! Spider-Man: No Way Home is truly the perfect conclusion to the trilogy, with each film combining to be the perfect origin for our hero. Tobey Maguire is amazing, Andrew Garfield is a hyper teen at heart and Tom Holland gives the best performances of his career within. I’m still in love with this film, it’s villains, heroes, score, storyline and emotional sequences all work like an absolute charm. "

"  The final films of the previous two live-action Spider-Man movie franchises both suffered terribly from superhero sequelitis, trying to squeeze in too many villains and too many story concepts.

"  Now that everyone has mostly seen the movie already, it's finally time for me to talk about this movie with more specific details. The MCU Spider-Man has been a mixed bag to be honest. I mean, I really liked what the Russo Brothers did with him in the Avengers movies, but his stand-alone titles just never connected with me. Homecoming was fine, and Far From Home felt like a filler storyline (besides the post credits scene). Tom Holland’s great in…  "
"  Fan service at it's finest. Trying to write a spoiler-free review of a movie is like trying to craft a restaurant review while being barred from mentioning any ingredient other than salt. It's a cleverly crafted reminder of that famous adage: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" The movie truly is a celebration of the character for the fans. I can’t see anyone leaving disappointed. It is the movie Spidey fans are looking for a long time. It is the…  "

 peter parker number 3 i love you 
 ok yes to the cultural impact yes to the fan service yes to the unreal cinematic experience but if those millions of millions of millions of dollars were put to use JUST to have andrew have this moment after the dedication he has shown to this character and the weird way it all ended for him it would’ve been worth it to me and my (now healed) 2014 self... if there’s one thing he’s always gonna do is deliver but the sheer emotional violence of his performance here!!!!!! i’m gonna fucking throw up 
"  Easily the weakest of the Holland movies so far, imo. Which is bonkers considering what happens in this freaking movie!Super weak writing and bland visuals. Is Jon Watts a computer program? (Watts is the director of this movie, FYI.) No visual snap whatsoever. Imagine if Raimi directed this thing. FUCK. Instead we get the dirty and dark visuals to cover up CGI everywhere. Peter fucking up the universe just so they can get into M.I.T, come on. Imagine going…  "

"  Marvel has mostly let their movies speak for themselves as fictional narratives that act as pure escapism and take us to other worlds, but in the same way that Episodes VII, VIII, and XI feel like two directors arguing about Star Wars should be, I feel like the MCU has used their biggest get to have a conversation with us about what it means to make movies that star Spider-Man.In Homecoming, an obvious title about the character’s formal universe entry,…  "

" SO…MUCH…MARVEL.I enjoyed the breeziness of how Watts takes characters we care about thanks to the first film’s charming approach and thrusts them into what felt like the “MOST” Marvel movie yet. My head is still spinning from all that plot. For all the big animatic-heavy set pieces and global franchise cameos, the moments visual comedy is still appreciated. My favorite scene(s) is [SPOILER ALERT] the three Peters hanging out talking shop. Simple, effective riffing like moments before someone called “Action!” "
"  I- just... wow. Holy shit, man.This is the Spider-Man film that I have wanted for so long. Operatic, weighty, inspiring, and insanely bitter-sweet. After all this time, I finally feel like the MCU has their Spider-Man.

"  The greatest way to bring together generations through cinema and finally end the age old argument of “who is the best Spider-Man.”Marvel truly understood how to appeal to your emotions in that gut wrenching way and crafted a beautiful storyline that encapsulates the essence of Spider-Man and who he truly is in the best live action adaptation.

" Too lazy to write an in-depth review of this, but I will say this. I thought it was very good overall. Seeing most of the major villains from the original Spidey films was great in itself, but it's the sight of Holland, Garfield and Maguire alongside each other that really makes this special. A very enjoyable ride that I'd say is the best of the MCU Spider-Man films. "

"  I’ve seen No Way Home twice now, and I’ve decided it’s the MCU’s best screenplay.While keeping the core of “what makes a Spider-Man” movie, they were able to deliver on Endgame-level fan service moments that rarely felt forced.

The countless references to the Original movies, an emotional Roller-coaster really did go next level with the film.

 Haha GOTCHAI’m not gonna spoil anything8/10 
 no Kirsten Dunst. zero stars 
 my immediate thoughts:1. Dr. Strange was right the entire movie and Peter brought all this shit on himself2. all Peter knows is loss 3. some parts of this movie were fun for the nostalgia factor BUT a lot of it felt like way too much fan service IMO4. Andrew Garfield presence in most things makes me happy 😊😊😊5. Norman was really serving in that lil hoodie and jacket outfit 
 Tobey and andrew were in it and that’s all that matters

 I cannot tell you the way I went INSANE when Charlie Cox reappeared as Daredevil for approximately fifteen secondsThis kept me invested for the entire runtime and was full of lots of arm punching moments between me and my brother… Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire deserve the world.Also Willem Dafoe never ever phoning it in is my favorite thing 
"  The last time I watched Spider-Man 3 I cried. Not because the movie was bad (it isn't great but I still like it) but because that was the last time any of those actors got to play those characters. Spider-Man first came out when I was 6 or 7 and I was already being raised on superhero movies like Batman and X-Men. Spider-Man took that to another level, it became a comfort movie for me, I would watch it all…  "
 Proves nostalgia is more powerful than anything cuz Aunt May dying didn’t do shit for me but I teared up when Andrew Garfield so much as breathed or Willem Dafoe smirked. 
"  MCU Spider-Man has been a big debate amongst the internet, hasn't he?While I have stated I enjoy Tom Holland's version of the web crawler since being introduced in Civil War, I can't say he was without his faults.

  This really was everything I was hoping it would be. When Charlie Cox showed up less than ten minutes in it was clear this was going to be something great.

"  I didn’t expect to come out of this enjoying Garfield’s Peter the most - Tobey could have perhaps brought more energy (probably thinking about his next poker game), but his reappearance was still like welcoming back an old friend, and I loved getting a glimpse of that suit and mask again.

"  Alright, so No Way Home has arrived and what do I think? This has to be the best live action Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2 and a massive improvement over the last two MCU Spider-Man movies.Like Shang-Chi before this was a game changer and shows the MCU still has a fight left by introducing the multiverses and opened the door for endless possibilities. It was really awesome seeing Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doc Ock,…  "
  One good look around and yup I'm definitely in the minority here. I'll start with some positives! Willem Dafoe is a powerhouse I mean god he gave it 100%. His confrontations with Spider-Man are so savage and makes for probably the best emotional/action moments in the entire film. The action in general was fantastic. Whether it was the hand to hand or magical fights (Dr. Strange was awesome gg Cumberbatch) they were all exhilarating. Holland himself gives his best Spider-Man…

Here's to comic book movies still managing to surprise me!Listen, I have been asking for an actual SPIDER-MAN movie in the MCU ever since I realized Holland's…  "
 After watching it for a second time I can definitely say it is one of the best film I have watched. They managed to bring all these characters back from the older films without ruining their legacies and managed to give Tobey maguire and Andrew Garfield a lot of screen time without taking the focus of the film away from Tom Holland. Willem Dafoe was amazing with one of the best performances I've seen in a comic book movie. 
 This is the only movie that came out this month to acknowledge Donkey Kong December. Five stars

"  ""I love you guys""The most impressive thing about No Way Home is how it manages to run down every item on its very long checklist while still retaining some kind of propulsive story.

 ANDREW'S SPIDERMAN SAVING MJ I CAN'T i'm broken 
  It wasn’t long after Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) revealed that with enough care and attention audiences would enjoy new superhero multiverse content that the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) devoted itself to a string of such shows and films. The latest edition to this list is the coming-of-age superhero film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). Director Jon Watts and crew cake on the fan-service as they attempt to align the previous 26 MCU films with 6 other outside Spider-Man and Spider-Man…

"  Listen, this is not a perfect film. Or, maybe it is, but I'll get to that. What I mean is that, well... For like half of it, the pacing is terribly off, and the writing is abysmal at times - especially when it comes to the dialogue. There's a blatant tonal shift literally thirty seconds into the damn film and it doesn't stop there either, it switches gears almost every three scenes and is relentless about it.But...It's fun.…  "

So here goes.Spiderman: No Way Home was everything I wanted it…  "
 it is extremely illegal how hot andrew garfield was looking in this movie… he can’t be real y’all

"  ""Hello Peter.""It is hard to believe we have been enjoying Spider-Man movies for twenty years. I still remember the first trailer for the first Spiderman with the Twin Towers. Where does the time go? We are also blessed that Marvel/Disney and Sony have found a way to work together. That gave us Tom Holland.Spider-Man is the most relatable character in the Marvel Universe and that translates again as we get to share another emotional journey. This film finds…  "
 i didn’t realize how emotionally ruined i was from tasm2 until i whispered “i miss gwen” not once… not twice… but seven times in the span of 10 minutes of seeing andrew in the spidey suit AND THE WAY I SOBBED WHEN HE CAUGHT MJ not be annoying bc tom’s spiderman has literally always been my favourite and this should be his movie BUT DAMN ANDREW I MISSED YOU (and tobey !!)

" An incredible look at just how much great power requires great responsibility. The acting was so, so emotional throughout. The trailer gave hints at what to expect, but I wasn't ready for a lot of it. The villains returning were a nice touch, especially seeing Dafoe cackling and the intimidating Alfred Molina again. We got so much more of Maguire and Garfield than most of us expected. I felt so appreciated to have cameos that were more of supporting characters than bit parts. I was blown away by the performances, the story, the visuals, everything. So refreshing. "
" Wow. Just wow. This movie was insane! A FANTASTIC theater experience. Idk why at the beginning he didn’t do the spell where Ned and MJ don’t forget and that’s it. But he didn’t want to get “messy” with aunt May like wtf. Anyway, totally recommend for everyone. "

"  Expanded thoughtsSpider-Man: No Way Home is like heading to a favorite restaurant in your hometown after a long period away and ordering your favorite meal only to find that the place has changed ownership and chefs.

Instead of high-quality fresh ingredients, it’s as processed as any fast-food joint, banking on reputation alone rather than feeding you a healthy meal.…  "
"  No Way Home is a fun popcorn flick with two different movies battling under the surface. One is an emotional and passionate ode to heroism and the icon of Spider-Man, and the other is the same MCU filler we’ve been fed for the last 10 years.The MCU movie in here is terrible. A lot of jokes didn’t land, the insistence on cgi clusterfucks creates visual diarrhea, and the necessity to meticulously craft the next 17463 movies is obnoxious. Yet,…  "

 This was the first time I’ve ever watched a MCU movie and it was undeniably very fantastic. Tom Holland and Zendaya bounce off each other and have created a new generation of Spider-Man. The humour is so candid and genuinely funny it lights up the whole movie giving it a little innocent nature vibe. SPOILER!The whole cinema erupted in cheers and screams with a round of applause each time Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield showed up. Everyone was very excited and the atmosphere had such a buzz. 
"  emotional labor and the american dream, heroes and villains vanishing into the aether; the new colossus stands as a bridge between morality and the relational, a golden door sealed by identity negation. the statue's flame ever-burning: the sun rises on the american institution, cap am's shield acting as a stage to replay and reinterpret popular consciousnesses of the grieving spider-men. cultural reset by way of the nostalgia machine—heroic generalities in spider-man's loneliness and deprogramming the evil, there's nothing left for…  "
"  - The More Fun Stuff Version - Two years after it released, this movie still feels unreal. I still have the widest smile on my face when Andrew and Tobey walk through the portals, and May's death and the goodbye between Peter, MJ and Ned at the end both still bring me close to tearsI've watched it seven times now in the last two years, and each time is just incredible. Although I'll never be able to top the…  "
"  Definitely an event and that much I can appreciate. Outside of that, I left pretty disappointed. Maybe it’s because I was already aware of the multi-spider twist but outside of being a cool gimmick I don’t think it added as much to the story as I thought it would. Even for Marvel I felt the logic/motivations were too convenient or just weak, and it took me out of the movie. It’s not an uncommon phenomenon for a movie to be…  "

"  I promised myself I was done with the MCU after Avengers Endgame, but I couldn’t resist watching this, even with all the hype surrounding this movie. It really delivered on the goods. I’ll admit some of the typical MCU jokes could've been cut out, but it delivered a compelling story, the nostalgia wasn’t just shoehorned in it helped progress the story, emotional moments, and it showed what it means to be Spider-Man. It’s not just fighting bad guys and protecting…  "
"  📦🗽2nd Viewing🗽📦💭General Thoughts Now that my hype has died down from seeing this the first time, my enjoyment decreased a smidge. The first half contains the same issues I have with the first two in the trilogy in its plethora of comedic attempts that don’t hit for me and overall style and tone. I love the silly/serious balance for the latter half but the first half I think didn’t take itself serious enough as I prefer. Once Peter fights…  "
 I want an entire film of the Dr.Strange mirror dimension. That is the coolest shit ever. Some other notes:This film has a lot of group hugs - a lot!Was the conversations between all three spidermen weird and awkward on purpose? Toby Maguire seemed oddly odd to me. The end title animation was awesome. Mirror dimension!!! 
 2021 using her last few breaths trying to usher in a Tobeyssance?? Desperate and sweaty babe 
 it's pretty great but i also don't think it deserves the absurdly good reviews it's getting. every time tobey talked i thought of The Boss Baby and every time Sandman talked i thought of Over the Hedge lol.i loved the part where Andrew saves M.J.Willem Dafoe fucking killed it as Green Goblin and May's death scene made me tear up a little.Overall i liked it a lot.the fucking credits scenes tho 
 Andrew saving MJ and the parallelism with Gwen:HOW CAN I RECOVER FROM THAT???!!!!!

"  Um, aunt May saying the great power great responsibility line and then being unceremoniously murdered a couple scenes later, with absolutely no precedent or foreshadowing so the movie can fumble over itself to catch up with the other spiderman movies, even though this spiderman has had by far the most movies and thus time to develop an interesting character, really embarrassingly highlights the depthless non-character that is Neo Marvels Peter and his worthless movies This is also the most blatantly…  "
  Spider-Man No Way Home is a 2021 released motion picture. It is the 27th film in the mcu and a sequel to Homecoming and Far From Home. Dear lord where do I even start. So a lot of people are declaring this movie is bad because it has fan service. Oh my god the absolute horror of that situation. These are the same types of people who think they’re clever for “discovering” that the Force Awakens is Star Wars (1977)…  
"  listen, i’m going to heap praise onto this movie, possibly due to extreme bias, but i feel like there’s a lot of genuine reasons why this is the best MCU movieabout halfway through No Way Home i realized that this is quite possibly the silliest MCU flick thus far and yet it was also the most emotionally invested i have ever been in any of these movies after 13 fucking years. and having that realization made me understand why…  "
 no you dont understand… im OBSESSED. i literally bawled my eyes out every single time i saw andrew garfield appear on screen and don’t think i will ever personally recover from gwen stacy’s fall. him catching mj and seeing the look of sadness yet relief on his face breaks my heart to the core. i will never get over this movie😭😭 THIS IS MY JOKER 
"  Hollywood, please stop allowing Jon Watts to tarnish things I like. No Way Home concludes the Homecoming “trilogy” (I use that word loosely) and to say I’ve had an interesting relationship with these films would be a massive understatement, I loved Homecoming on my first few viewings but as time passes, it just gets more forgettable and I find less to enjoy about it. Far from Home was always something I didn’t like but it feels like such a slog…  "

  Just in case Letterboxd doesn't make it clear: THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.[IMAX at the AMC Alderwood 16]I should love this movie because it's like the screenwriters designed this climactic episode to address my primary objections to most superhero stories: It stresses responsibility — a theme I've always appreciated in Spidey-tales — and it takes a higher road than usual: It refuses to satiate the audience's appetite for climactic executions. It's focused more on loving enemies than eliminating them. Hell…  
 i cant believe andrew garfield tom holland and tobey maguire spent MONTHS lying right to our fucking faces 
  THIS IS MY SPOILER REVIEW- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE LEAVE!!!I can't believe they were in it. It was a surreal experience when they walked through those portals. The cheers were comparable to a football match. They didn't waste them either. Tobey was given an extremely satisfying conclusion- finally giving us some clarity on what happened next after 14 years (I'd still kill for a fourth movie though.) His inclusion was great and was the perfect role-model for…

"  65I’ve already said this, but the MCU brain rot didn’t really set in until after Endgame came out, and apart from Eternals I was mid at best on everything released in Phase Four. I was really hoping Spider-Man: No Way Home would be another exception. I was at least intrigued by the idea of the three Peter Parker’s teaming up together, and I’m not going to tell you it’s abysmal, but the realization quickly set in that as charming…  "
 aaahh you guys don’t understand how hard i tried to stop myself from watching the camcorded copy of this and aaaahh it was all worth it!!! watching this at the cinema was such a great experience!! i finally got to see my fave peter parker (andrew’s peter parker) again aaaahh the gwen stacy references?????? shitting tears rn 😭😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻 
"  Went with my sister to No Way Home. We see every Spider-Man together so it was especially emotional to see the three United together. Felt like a cinematic reward for our commitment and relationship with each other throughout the years, which is a nice foray into the holiday feelings garden. Which is to say, this is awkward in a structural sense and not in a forced Far From Home type of way. No Way Home also imitates the calculated and…  "

First, I saw this movie in the AutoNation IMAX theater at the Museum of Discovery and Science and it was one of the best moviegoing experiences of my life. 300 seats sold out with a screen that’s six stories tall.…  "
 Honestly this is definantly my favorite MCU film so far. Seeing the villians rom the previous Spider - Man films was amazing. The whole theater started to clap when Tobey and Andrew showed up.Also holy shit Venom and Daredevil cameos 
  Gosh this was fucking great. I soooooooo unfortunately didn't incredibly enjoy it but I still know it's great and the more I think about it I like it more. Tom may be my favourite spiderman they done him so good. This genuinely has a great story to it and had a great redemption for Jamie Fox as electro. Willem Dafoe gives a top notch performance and its literally one of the best in the MCU. The CGI on Molina is…  
"  We won y’all. This is the ultimate fan service.We really got a Spiderman movie with Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland. Like are you kidding me? Just like Endgame and Infinity War, this made me feel a series of emotions and I love it for that. We also go Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe back and both of them killed it. Anyone with a brain knows that those two are the most iconic villains in any Spiderman movie…  "

I laughed and squealed. I didn’t cry. When would you guys even cry? That’s weird. Aunt May should’ve died faster. "
  i’m still processing all of my thoughts with this movie and the many emotions i had during it. there’s movie was incredible and everything i dreamed it would be. just for the nostalgia alone this deserves 5 stars but so much more impacted me. tom holland as spider-man shines in this. he plays a perfect peter parker and it shows in this film especially. spider-man is my favorite male superhero and peter parker is my favorite character. there’s something so comforting…  
"  Still so fun. Breaking down walls. Worlds colliding. The first time Octavious shows up on the bridge it really gets the heart pumping. By the time Green Goblin shows up the whole movie feels stuck in high gear. It's awesome.I was glad to have recently watched the Andrew Garfield movies before going into this, it really tied the room together. I dug Electro's makeover. The CGI for both the Lizard and the Sandman were kinda bogus in my opinion.…  "

" “Peter three!!!”Just as effective and emotional the second time around which I find really rare for these kinds of action films. The Spideys’ natural chemistry together elevates the scenes of them just hanging around like friends, and the insane roster of villains really raises the stakes with an especially impressive showing from Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and even Jamie Foxx surprised.2021 Ranked🗓: https://boxd.it/b8ksU "
"  Sorry to all fans of “Spider-Boy.” This is the film where Tom Holland’s Peter Parker truly becomes “Spider-Man.” A crowd-pleasing and emotionally rewarding tale of loss, heroism, and legacy, this almost acts as an origin story for a superhero that I didn’t think needed one. But, man, am I glad that this exists. No Way Home is an absolute blast. I had so much fun. Of course, you have the classic villains returning. Sure, some of them aren’t so great…  "
"  You have a gift. You have power. And with great power, there must also come great responsibility. A love letter to Spider-Man films. Of course I cried.What a perfectly crafted piece of fan service. And beyond being a jaw-dropping experience, it combines a lot of what makes Spider-Man Spider-Man.Tom Holland's Spider-Man has learned (in and out of the screen) from the previous Spider-Men and as a result, this MCU Spidey is a well-rounded hero now.Heartbreaking and exciting.…  "

"  Originally Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was to release before No Way Home then we had the pandemic. There's a clear impact with reversing the order of the films.Thematically it would make sense that Doctor Strange would engage with America Chavez first.

  Kızmayın ama bence çok fan-service bir film olmuş. Çok daha iyisi yapılabilecek bir filmin potansiyelini 13 yaş ve altı fanlar için heba etmişler. Yine bir sürü saçma ve gereksiz espriler mevcuttu. Bu espri işini bu kadar abartmaları hep saçma buluyorum. Winter Soldier filmini çıkartmış olan bir stüdyonun yeni çıkartacağı filmlerini de bu ciddiyette yapmasının daha iyi olacağını düşünüyorum. Filmde beğenmediğim bir sürü şey vardı ama bence en saçma olayı MCU'daki en güçlü karakterlerden biri olan Doctor Strange'i küçük düşürmeleriydi. Tamam…  
 i am so impressed wow. i cant stop thinking about the mirror dimension- so cool. and there’s no way they’re not connecting this to into the spider-verse because i know you all saw the parallels between the apartment/snow/comic book flash thing at the very end and i just can’t wait. 
"  This is a top rate Spider-Man joint. I would say it's as good as Spider-Man 2 and Into the Spiderverse. They are able to close off the story of Tom Holland's Parker while continuing and putting a bow on Tobey MacGuire and Andrew Garfield's stories. When you throw in five villains and Doctor Strange on top of that, the balancing act is very impressive.The layer underneath the multiverse fun is talking about that moment when you're young when you…  "

"  You know, I’m a scientist myself.This right here is my Saturday Morning Cartoon. A crossover episode for the ages. I think to reiterate, it’s important that this arc of Tom Holland is over for now. Teenager Spider-Man wanted to help all the villains be cured and obviously it leads to a climatic event. Bringing the three Spider-Man’s into our universe perfectly ties together the arcs that were left unsolved. Particularly, Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man has more whimsicality in this because…  "

  Finally! This movie was out for a whole month before I saddled up and committed to a week night to go see it in theatres.

"  It’s worth pausing for a minute just to acknowledge what “Spider-Man: No Way Home” actually accomplishes. For all its well-documented faults, I still think the MCU is taken for granted in a way that occasionally undersells the ambition with which they handle their properties. For years, Spider-Man as a character has been mocked for getting repeatedly rebooted with new actors to the point where nobody was all that interested in whoever was in the costume anymore. It’s a major credit…  "
"  Spider-Man: No Way Home captures - more than any other MCU film to date - the marriage of the mundane and the fantastic that characterizes Marvel's version of New York City.

One hard cut later and the ominous sounding Undercroft is revealed as an average brownstone basement. On either side of that cut exist the two seemingly…  "

"  The idea was certainly there, I can't deny this was a nice effort, but the result was a massive disappointment. What an insufferable, stupid movie, it's funny that once again we have to sit through two and a half hours of this shit just because Tom Holland's Spiderman is dumb and makes stupid decisions.

" Additional thoughtsSpider-Man 2 (2004) remains my favorite film with the arachnid vigilante (No Way Home is great but too comedically inclined in its first half = MCU COCD) but I have to give it to Andrew Garfield now as the best actor of the three. His time as Spidey was just let down by the writers, not his performances. And I will always stand by that. "

" Spider-Man One becomes a loner. A.G.’s Spider-Man redeemed. Spider-Man Two is a boss. The character arcs of the Spider-Men is what makes this film. Loved it. Dafoe rocks. All the above overcomes the movie’s contrived “MCU-ness”, e.g. plot, Dr. Strange magic logic, fan service, etc. "

With this Homecoming Trilogy coming to a close it seems almost mandatory to send it off with one bigger and better then the past two.

  So many regular MCU problems in this film. Everything happens and resolves in such a boring and anticlimactic way. I didn’t care at all for Andrews villains because they weren’t well developed in their own movies sadly. But all of Tobeys villains were as fantastic as they were years ago. Watching this made me realise how great the Sam Rami trilogy is- despite 3 having issues. These films felt dark and had interesting developed villain character moments. Sadly something we…

Everything feels like its come full circle. No Way Home is the best movie in Jon Watts' Spiderman trilogy. It's also top-tier Spiderman, top-tier MCU, and well worth the high score its getting on Letterboxd!They nailed the humor, the storytelling, and the acting in this. I cannot believe that Willem…  "
"  Going into this film, I was incredibly nervous and expected it would be an incredibly entertaining movie, but far from great. The trailers had some cool moments, but it really seemed like the story of the film was a mess, the concept of the multiverse opening because Peter was being stupid in a spell just didn't sound very compelling to me and I thought it looked like they were focusing more on the fanservice than creating a good story, but…  "

" They did one horrendous job at keeping all those secrets.Despite it all amounting to a surprisingly beautiful consolation scene and doing a rather decent, respectful job at differentiating the three generations (until they’re all MCU-pilled) and providing them with some welcome closure and character growth, every unspoilable twist in blockbusters now is “who’s that Pokémon”, nearly every joke in superhero movies now (but 98% this one) is “your powers come from where now? Uhhhhhh, that happened!” and how I wish I hadn’t been through enough of it all to feel the opposite of how everyone else was reacting when Guess Who showed up. "
  A film that's drenched in Cgi and Thrives on the already established nostalgia is bound to make you emotional when you see the familiar faces. But on an individual level No Way Home does nothing different. It's hollowness is even exemplified when you realize that neither of the main characters in the film can evoke a sense of belonging or create a tense situation. The film however becomes way more interesting when we get the obvious communion of the Spidermen…

Maguire and Garfield are used so well to help complement Holland’s arc. It was so cool to see them offer him guidance and perspective on being Spider-Man instead of just being used as fan service. They’re instrumental to Holland’s journey and help show him what it means to put…  
 Couldn't decide on one review so you get the magic number three:1. And then Deadpool walks in 😂😂😂2. I wish I could forget Peter Parker too3. This bad boy's going to be advertising 4K TVs for years to come(Vote for your favorite in the comments) 
"  Yeah sure?I’m realizing marvel is just an endless plot line, the set up already happened and ended with endgame and now it’s just how do we create hype and top ourselves. This movie is the best example of the terrible hype cycle and everything I don’t like about marvel. The only reason people are excited about this movie is because it opens up the multiverse and introduces all the cute characters from the other Spider-Man’s. Theres nothing there besides…  "
 ANDREW AND ZENDAYA INTERACTION GUYS. all the rumors are true. currently crying and throwing up and shaking. NO CAUSE THIS MOVIE DESERVES ALL THE HYPE AND OH MY GOD. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. JUST FUCKING WATCH IT 
"  Now THIS was a Spider-Man film.In 2018, I hated Far From Home so much that I refused to watch another MCU project. Unfortunately I am a Spider-Man fan first and MCU hater second so I had to break that rule and go see this opening night and OH BOY WAS THAT THE RIGHT CALL.This is now MCU Spider-Man 1. Homecoming and Far From Home no longer exist in my head. Aunt May is Uncle Ben. Tom Holland is…  "
"  Spoiler thoughts,1-So, Doctor Strange is no longer the sorcerer supreme. Wong is. Which makes Shang Chi make more sense, (Shang Chi spoilers ahead) as Wong was the one to go after the ten rings in the credit scene, which duties like these are Strange's (The credit scene with strange and Thor) 2- This isn't the first time that Marvel does the ""we are doing too many things in one film but will make it work"" thing, they did it…  "
"  I decided to watch Spider-Man No Way Home: The More Fun Stuff Edition which adds another 11 minutes to the theatrical cut. Overall, the extra footage was a mixed bag, and most of the footage I am glad they cut from the theatrical version (which is why this rating is lower). There were some welcomed additions, such as some funny dialogue during the damage control interrogations, an extended dialogue between our three beloved Spider-Men, an extra Matt Murdock scene representing…  "
"  The Way to Madness - Part 6Nun war es also auch an der Zeit für den Rewatch von Spider-Man: No Way Home und ich war sehr gespannt, wie dieser bei mir nach diesem wirken würde.Ich war ja nach dem Kino etwas zwiegespalten darüber, wie ich den Film nun wirklich fand.Geplättet vom ganzen Fanservice und der ungeheuren Menge an Figuren fiel es mir schwer, den Film wirklich einzuordnen.Und ja, meine Kritikpunkte, die ich an ihm hatte, bleiben…  "
 can't believe i'm rating a mcu movie this high in the good year of 2022 but when andrew's peter saved mj and made That face i knew i was a goner 
 something lgbt happened to tobey maguire and andrew garfield 
"  Just going to chain gun this one out. Watts is spinning a lot of plates with this one. Too bad most of them fall to the floor and shatter into a million pieces, much like Manhattan does in the mirror dimension. No Way Home garners great success via the performances of Holland, Zendaya, and Dafoe, and through the handling of Aunt May's death. The rest is noise, the resounding death throes of stories in favor of corporate filmmaking—the same sort…  "
 Andrew saving MJ in the way he failed saving Gwen was PAINFUL but also the best thing I’ve ever seen 
 🕷 
 they are so sick for including that scene where andrew’s spider-man caught mj 
"  Definitely a love letter to Spider-Man fans everywhere. Whether you’re a fan of the comics, or the films, or even all the memes. This movie gives the people what they want while managing to pull through with a great story as well. if only Stan Lee and Steve Ditko were alive to see this movie today. We’ve seen the Spider-Verse unfold on comics, cartoons, and now in live action, it’s unbelievable but wow, I loved every second of it. I…  "
" perfect, literally flawless. i can't even begin to describe the happiness i felt at every conceivable moment, and after tobey and andrew walked through those portals 😍😍 GENUINELY SPEECHLESS. the costumes, jokes, throwbacks, action, acting! i couldn't believe what i was seeing! after all this time - they were back and the villans were back 🥲🥲🥲 i'm still speechless 6 days after watching it. i loved it so much. i can't believe marvel really did it and did it so perfectly! the mcu's new best film. i'm just so happy that i literally can't think!! "
 Cried laugh horny for Andrew Garfield 
" Interactions between the three Spider+Men pretty much sum this up: Maguire and Garfield are great together (some of Maguire's best work here, even) and Holland is a total dud; still not sold on him at all. Definite course correction at play for the character, though.Liked it better than I expected but I wouldn't pay for this probably.MCU Peter Parker the second worst Parker after Santonio. "
"  Today was a good day and this was like a dream come true for a Spider-man fan like myself. I couldn't believe that I was actually watching the film because everyone had talked theories but I had avoided spoilers until I could see it. Seeing Tobey in theaters again was nostalgic and brought back a good memory of my first film in theaters, Spider-man 3. I was extremely invested in the story and got very emotional at some points. I've…  "

 THIS IS A SPIDER-MAN FAN'S WET DREAM!!!!!!! I CRIED WHEN ANDREW'S PETER CAUGHT MJ!!!!! AND HE WAS CRYING!!!! THIS IS EVERYTHING I WANTED AND MORE!!!!!!!!!!!! 
  I got everything I wanted out of this movie. Tom Holland is definitely at his best here and seeing everybody come back and all the references and callbacks? I'm a happy gal. I absolutely loved how crazed Willem Dafoe got here and I'm so happy to see Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. There are some issues but nothing that ruins or really brings down the film. I should probably rewatch this when the hype starts to die down because literally…  
"  I don't even know where to begin, I went in with such low expectations after all the MCU has done is disappoint recently, but this film DELIVERED and I am so happy with it!We got Matt Murdock and Kingpin in the MCU in the same week, how lucky we are. And the other Spidermen being in this for half of the film was a dream come true! There were so many good moments and Tom Holland is at his…  "
 the scene when andrew caught mj… when she was falling… just like gwen fell… i’m still processing 
 dude it was so good. literally so sick. go see it rn. worth all the hype and praise. great villains and great twists and reveals ( even if they were leaked ) still so iconic. theater erupted several times and i was there for it. Andrew’s STILL goated.

"  “Peter, Peter, Peter…no good deed goes unpunished.”Worst theater experience I’ve had this year. Had a family of idiots that were hacking with nasty phlegmy coughs. They brought a gigantic Walmart bag of candies with soda cans and they  always made sure they made anytime they opened a bag that it was the loudest noise in the room. Not to mention their kid playing Among Us while the film was going on. Or the fact that the dad of the…  "
  - Review in a bit but for now I’ll just say sweet baby Jesus this is incredible.- Here’s that review.- There’s no way something like this should ever exist. These characters should never interact together in the same universe as each other it should never of happened but it did.- There’s a reason Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors and Green Goblin is my favorite Spider-Man villain and one of my favorite villains of all…  
"  This was the pinnacle of Spider-man movies (to me). I rented a theater for this for me and about 52 friends and with the exception of one person we all loved it but there is so much to unpack. This movie opens so many doors and also closes so many. The Action, Comedy, nostalgia, and pain where all apparent.

"  “I love you guys!”WHAT A RIDEEEE. THAT was my best cinematic experience. The audience went completely insane. I still can’t believe my favorite Spidey (Andrew’s) made a comeback! Seeing those 3 versions of Peter Parker in one screen feels like a dream. I’m really glad the 3 of them got along well and had a great chemistry, it made the movie better & funnier. My absolute favorite moment of the movie was when the Spider-Mans did their iconic landing poses…  "

"  Kind of an unfortunate tug of war between genuinely a heartfelt Peter Parker / Spider-Man story and dumbass point at the screen and clap fan-service. This is the epitome of what Martin Scorsese was saying when he called Marvel films ""theme park attractions"" (actually maybe the avengers movies are more so, but I'm not watching them).

  Spider-Man: No Way Home is not perfect. It's not one of the greatest films of all time. It's a film with many pros and many cons:PROS:• Actually I was on board from the get go. Love the exciting tense intro. Love the music.• DAREDEVIL.• Seeing the villains again is awesome. Especially Doc Ock and Goblin. Willem Dafoe as always is brilliantly eerie and is given the most time to shine with his villainy.• The film…  
"  Any fears that I wouldn't love this were immediately dispelled by the Talking Heads needle drop during the first five minutes.Sure, it's handled a little clumsily in places, the setpieces were somewhat disappointing and it suffers from some of that standardised-feeling weightlessness prevalent within the MCU at this point, but to bring together these universes in a way that is (mostly) cohesive, comedically effective and emotionally satisfying to a long term Spider-Man fan is no mean feat.

"  “For the fans” but then what the hell isn’t these days? That said, I think Garfield is genuinely fantastic in this. It’s as if he’s internalized the disappointment of being a failed Spider-Man–in both the textual and metatextual sense–and can barely conceal his need for validation, like a seal bouncing a ball on its nose. It’s unwavering positivity attempting to compensate for self-doubt and shame (which again, the film is very much encouraging the viewer to read as self-commentary on…  "

All of you made the impossible happen to people who really needed it.Sitting down in the theater I felt like a kid again.

 andrew garfield seyit onbaşının çanakkale cephesinde sırtında taşıdığı mermi gibi sırtlanmış filmi helal olsun aslanıma 
 Coming to terms with the fact that Andrew Garfield is my favorite one 
" This was fun! The usage of the multiverse villains and heroes could’ve led to some extremely ham-fisted moments (and there are a few let’s be real) but overall it was handled far more maturely than I expected. Tom Holland really killed it here, and by the end you can tell he’s surely a definitive Spider-Man. It’s really not a masterpiece like everyone is making it out to be, some of the filmmaking choices particularly felt very uninspired, but it could’ve been a lot worse. "

 Never in a million years would I have predicted that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker would be the best character in this movie

" the whole theatre ERUPTED, ya’ll know when.i cant breathe this was absolutely phenomenal best film of the year. i WEPT when andrew saved MJ and was talking about gwen. i swear to god i’m not okay. "
" Marvel is so good at getting people to do things for money in a way that reads like love. there's some very cutesy stuff here (most of it an ominous, logical continuation of the content snake eating its own tail), CGI New York City is a really a Character Unto Itself lolol, and Jon Watts is now unquestionably the worst director to ever make a Spider-Man movie. also, not a spoiler, lol at Pete and his friends for simply *assuming* they'd all get into MIT. a very cool premise for a $250 million movie.

" SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME swings for the fences with the most ambitious live-action Spider-Man film yet. The execution can be a bit messy due to the overabundance of villains & CGI (most of which we’ve seen done in previous films before) but the stirring highs are worth it. Features Tom Holland’s most emotional & best performance to date. Out of all the villains, Willem Dafoe once again steals the show as the sinister Green Goblin. What a treat it was getting to see him reprising this iconic adversary nearly twenty years later. "

 andrew garfield appearing on the screen was the best moment i’ve ever experienced in a cinema OMGGGG

" It was a bizarre, somewhat surreal moment when the other spider-men came in that i felt like i was watching some badly fan-edited/tiktok video. Tobey looked like he didn’t want to be there half the time and i love him for it.

"  What’s wrong with the previous Holland movies that isn’t wrong with this one? Did you just need to hear someone say “with great power comes great responsibility” and then die? It’s not like in this instance it’s even the consequence of a character flaw/shortcoming for Peter grow out of. You could argue it motivates vengeance, but this just leads to flip-flopping character motivation where Peter only spends about 5 minutes total set on killing Osborn before being easily talked out…  "
"  Although the gimmickry is fun from front to back, the ultimate key to the movie's success is its refusal to rest on the easy laurels of those gimmicks. The nostalgic joy of familiar faces is made resonant by the power of Aunt May's shocking death, of villains capable of both goodwill and destruction, of three perfectly unique webslingers bonding over grief, of Garfield's Spider-Man so poignantly stopping MJ's fall, and of an ending that follows ""depression is rage turned inward""…  "

"  HEAVY SPOILERS:What a joy this was to watch. Fan service in the best way possible. When Andrew Garfield showed up on screen, the theater screamed in unison.

"  Seeing all the Raimi characters here really showed off how ugly this movie was. Those films are visual marvels inventing the genre in a way we can barely remember. Andrew Garfield is such a fantastic actor. Beautiful to see him redeemed here!

"  Screenplays don’t come up much when we discuss superhero movies, but Spider-Man: No Way Home reminds us that they’re as crucial as casting and special effects. After their smart, high school-centric scripts for Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, both starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers are faced with a daunting task: maintain the small-scale, adolescent intimacy they’ve established while also serving up a metaversal, multi-character narrative that draws from the pre-Holland feature films…  "

" Andrew Garfield bringing his theatre kid energy to the MCU is a real highlight! Spider-Man: No Way Home is truly the perfect conclusion to the trilogy, with each film combining to be the perfect origin for our hero. Tobey Maguire is amazing, Andrew Garfield is a hyper teen at heart and Tom Holland gives the best performances of his career within. I’m still in love with this film, it’s villains, heroes, score, storyline and emotional sequences all work like an absolute charm. "

" spider-man: no way home is everything i could have asked for in a spider-man film, and it may be my favorite spider-man film to date. i found the interactions between maguire, garfield, and holland to be the highlight of the movie, but i appreciated that their appearances didn’t overshadow holland’s story. i’m not sure where mcu’s spider-man will go from here, but i’ve loved every moment of holland’s portrayal up to this point.

" Too lazy to write an in-depth review of this, but I will say this. I thought it was very good overall. Seeing most of the major villains from the original Spidey films was great in itself, but it's the sight of Holland, Garfield and Maguire alongside each other that really makes this special. A very enjoyable ride that I'd say is the best of the MCU Spider-Man films. "

"  No Way Home feels very much like the filmmakers were constantly asking, “What will Spider-Man fans really love?” and then did that.

"  I’ve seen No Way Home twice now, and I’ve decided it’s the MCU’s best screenplay.While keeping the core of “what makes a Spider-Man” movie, they were able to deliver on Endgame-level fan service moments that rarely felt forced. The idea that Peter Parker would want to help these villains and not just defeat them was moving to me in a very unexpected way. The dynamic between the three Spider-Men was perfect, and each of them maintained their individual personalities while bouncing…  "

" A Cinematic masterpiece. The film was crazy in terms of the original Villains, turning up. The countless references to the Original movies, an emotional Roller-coaster really did go next level with the film. The story was fantastic and most importantly, and most importantly Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield do indeed turn up at the end of the movie joining Holland's spider man and they absolutely rocked the cinema. Every one was goimg extremely wild and it was just crazy. A wonderfully created experience "

 Saw it again at the TCL Chinese IMAX. When the audience realized Peter 3 was going to be the one to save MJ the reaction was the loudest thing I’ve ever heard in a movie theater. Ever. But my favorite part was when Patrick Wilson called the moon a “son of a bitch” in the MOONFALL trailer. THAT is cinema. 
" Still not sure that this deserves a Best Picture nomination, but… it does get better with each subsequent viewing, and I will never tire of seeing it with a packed audience. I’ll admit a lot of my initial emotions were fueled by my cynicism about what the film represents vs. what it actually is, and when I let that go, I have an absolute blast. Still really hard to reconcile with the death of any theatrical release that isn’t a superhero film, but that’s not Spider-Man’s fault!And, Andrew Garfield MVP.

Mostly coming from the tone shift to wacky hijinks and Spidey's need to be connected to overall MCU rather than focus on him being his own hero.

"  But this isn’t about me.

"  While an undeniably fun ride, Spiderman No Way Home is part of a broader trend in modern film that I find myself less and less responsive to.

"  So much to say about this one and I’ve let it sit a lot, so here we go. Spider-Man: No Way Home, despite the 3 stars, was a lot better than I thought it was going to be.

"  The More Fun Stuff VersionWe've had many director's cuts, extended cuts, and unrated cuts but it's truly rare when a film goes back to the theater with deleted scenes reinstated into it.'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is already a blockbuster phenomenon, anchoring itself right next to 'Avengers: Infinity War' & 'Avengers: Endgame'. But Marvel Studios is notorious for excluding extended or director's cuts because the final theatrical release is considered the ""director's true vision"", for better or for worse.But…  "

  This really was everything I was hoping it would be. When Charlie Cox showed up less than ten minutes in it was clear this was going to be something great. Just the fact that the three of them were on screen together was incredible but the dynamic between the Spider-Men was pitch perfect.

"  An emphatic reinforcement that Andrew Garfield is the best Spiderman from the worst Spiderman movies. He and Willem Dafoe steal this movie.I feel like I need to recalibrate how I assess the MCU movies, because their very worst tendancies are not going anywhere (this is particularly poorly directed and abjectly ugly). Yet, I as a viewer probably arent going anywhere either and that is frustrating realisation to have. There was joy to be found here primarily in the performances…  "

"  I didn’t expect to come out of this enjoying Garfield’s Peter the most - Tobey could have perhaps brought more energy (probably thinking about his next poker game), but his reappearance was still like welcoming back an old friend, and I loved getting a glimpse of that suit and mask again.

"  Alright, so No Way Home has arrived and what do I think? This has to be the best live action Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2 and a massive improvement over the last two MCU Spider-Man movies.Like Shang-Chi before this was a game changer and shows the MCU still has a fight left by introducing the multiverses and opened the door for endless possibilities. It was really awesome seeing Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doc Ock,…  "
  One good look around and yup I'm definitely in the minority here. I'll start with some positives! Willem Dafoe is a powerhouse I mean god he gave it 100%. His confrontations with Spider-Man are so savage and makes for probably the best emotional/action moments in the entire film. The action in general was fantastic. Whether it was the hand to hand or magical fights (Dr. Strange was awesome gg Cumberbatch) they were all exhilarating. Holland himself gives his best Spider-Man…

"  “Peter, you're struggling to have everything you want while the world tries to make you choose.”There will be spoilers in this review but to sum up my thoughts, I love this movie. It is my favorite of the year, but it is hard for me to talk about it without talking about specific scenes or reveals. The best way to see this movie is knowing as little as possible about the story. That said, here is the review:Spider-Man:…  "
"  Even though this Spider-Man might not be the best movie quality wise, it is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in a while as it really serves as a crowd-pleaser, but it does it in a way only a Spider-Man movie could do it.Tom Holland plays the main character, but this movie is less about him and more about all the other classic characters that were featured in previous franchises. These characters include villains like Willem Dafoe's…  "

"  Spider-Man: HomiesOnce the leaks and rumors started to come in, anyone who had discussed No Way Home with me knows I voiced my concern about this film multiple times. During a certain period of all of the hype building, I wouldn't even consider myself excited for it. Now, look at this. Here's to comic book movies still managing to surprise me!Listen, I have been asking for an actual SPIDER-MAN movie in the MCU ever since I realized Holland's…  "
 After watching it for a second time I can definitely say it is one of the best film I have watched. They managed to bring all these characters back from the older films without ruining their legacies and managed to give Tobey maguire and Andrew Garfield a lot of screen time without taking the focus of the film away from Tom Holland. Willem Dafoe was amazing with one of the best performances I've seen in a comic book movie. 
 This is the only movie that came out this month to acknowledge Donkey Kong December. Five stars

"  Extended cut.Very clunky, juggling an awkward surplus of tones and concepts that don't work almost as often as they do, but containing enough blunt charm to make it worthwhile. The pacing is all over the place, and I guess the additional 10 minutes of what's practically just fanservice don't help much.

It is impossible to not be impressed by the way marvel has connected 30 years of history in one single universe. The scope here is magnificent. They brought all of the beloved villains back, they got Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back, but most importantly, they got that feeling back. The acting…  "

"  ""I love you guys""The most impressive thing about No Way Home is how it manages to run down every item on its very long checklist while still retaining some kind of propulsive story.

Seeing all of the characters from different Spider-Man movies was great! When Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield appeared the crowd went crazy. I was so happy to experience that!…  "
"  I think it's safe to say that ""Spiderman No Way Home"" is already in my top 5 marvel movies and not only did it meet my expectations it completely surpassed my expectations in every single way from top to bottom and seeing both ""Toby Maguire"" and ""Andrew Garfield"" show up was a very nice and a very big welcomed piece of nostalgia more so when ""Toby Maguire"" showed up for me because it reminded of when I was only 12…  "

"  So, No Way Home. I can't believe this movie exists. I'm stunned.The fact that we have a movie we will be able to watch for years and years that contains characters from various Spider-Man eras is astounding. We are so lucky.The film picks up right after Far From Home. Peter Parker is outed as Spider-Man and as a consequence he and his friends are constantly being put in the public eye due to said reveal.

"  Expanded thoughtsSpider-Man: No Way Home is like heading to a favorite restaurant in your hometown after a long period away and ordering your favorite meal only to find that the place has changed ownership and chefs. The warm, rustic look of the original establishment has been replaced with smooth textures and a personality drained color scheme. Instead of high-quality fresh ingredients, it’s as processed as any fast-food joint, banking on reputation alone rather than feeding you a healthy meal.…  "
"  No Way Home is a fun popcorn flick with two different movies battling under the surface. One is an emotional and passionate ode to heroism and the icon of Spider-Man, and the other is the same MCU filler we’ve been fed for the last 10 years.The MCU movie in here is terrible. A lot of jokes didn’t land, the insistence on cgi clusterfucks creates visual diarrhea, and the necessity to meticulously craft the next 17463 movies is obnoxious. Yet,…  "
"  I have to admit that whenever Tobey’s face was on screen, I could just feel myself welling up. Also, there are lots of small things that I love about this film but my favourite simply has to be Tom’s Spider-Man beating the shit out of Goblin in the apartment hallways and Goblin just looking up and laughing maniacally… brilliant! He also gave me Wild at Heart vibes when he’s smiling up at Peter towards the end. One of my biggest…  "

"  Das ist kein Film mehr, sondern nur noch 148 Minuten langer Fanservice Bullshit, dem nichts mehr heilig ist. Peter Parker hat zwei Identitäten - dieser Film hat gar keine. Praktisch jede Figur und Schauspieler, aus den letzten 20 Filmjahren ""Spider Man"" schaut vorbei und darf seinen ikonischten Satz zum Besten geben.

"  With great power must also come great responsibility.This is Tom Holland's best performance as Spider-Man and probably the best Spider-Man movie ever.

"  I found this more satisfactory than satisfying, maybe because the colossal shouldering of expectations and all the under-wraps plotting heavily implied from all of the promos.

"  I don’t wanna write a spoiler review cause that’s not what I do on here but it’s hard to not talk about this film without spoiling it. The MCU fell into the pressure of having Tobey & Andrew.

"  I wanted to see it again before writing my complete thoughts. Besides the fact that Andrew and Tobey are back, this is a great Tom Holland movie! Using villains from previous movies is so nostalgic and the banter between them is so entertaining.

 started crying when my meow meow showed up and then just didn’t stop.. andrew garfield i LOVE you !!!! 
 This was the first time I’ve ever watched a MCU movie and it was undeniably very fantastic. Tom Holland and Zendaya bounce off each other and have created a new generation of Spider-Man. The humour is so candid and genuinely funny it lights up the whole movie giving it a little innocent nature vibe. SPOILER!The whole cinema erupted in cheers and screams with a round of applause each time Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield showed up. Everyone was very excited and the atmosphere had such a buzz.

 I want an entire film of the Dr.Strange mirror dimension.

  Just in case Letterboxd doesn't make it clear: THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.[IMAX at the AMC Alderwood 16]I should love this movie because it's like the screenwriters designed this climactic episode to address my primary objections to most superhero stories: It stresses responsibility — a theme I've always appreciated in Spidey-tales — and it takes a higher road than usual: It refuses to satiate the audience's appetite for climactic executions. It's focused more on loving enemies than eliminating them. Hell…

The cheers were comparable to a football match. They didn't waste them either.

"  Went with my sister to No Way Home. We see every Spider-Man together so it was especially emotional to see the three United together. Felt like a cinematic reward for our commitment and relationship with each other throughout the years, which is a nice foray into the holiday feelings garden. Which is to say, this is awkward in a structural sense and not in a forced Far From Home type of way. No Way Home also imitates the calculated and…  "
"  His Origin Story is Complete*spoilers*        This is probably the hardest review I have ever had to write. I have wanted to see this movie since 2007. I have so many things I want to say. First, I saw this movie in the AutoNation IMAX theater at the Museum of Discovery and Science and it was one of the best moviegoing experiences of my life. 300 seats sold out with a screen that’s six stories tall.…  "
 Honestly this is definantly my favorite MCU film so far. Seeing the villians rom the previous Spider - Man films was amazing. The whole theater started to clap when Tobey and Andrew showed up.Also holy shit Venom and Daredevil cameos 
  Gosh this was fucking great. I soooooooo unfortunately didn't incredibly enjoy it but I still know it's great and the more I think about it I like it more. Tom may be my favourite spiderman they done him so good. This genuinely has a great story to it and had a great redemption for Jamie Fox as electro. Willem Dafoe gives a top notch performance and its literally one of the best in the MCU. The CGI on Molina is…  
"  We won y’all. This is the ultimate fan service.We really got a Spiderman movie with Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland. Like are you kidding me? Just like Endgame and Infinity War, this made me feel a series of emotions and I love it for that. We also go Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe back and both of them killed it. Anyone with a brain knows that those two are the most iconic villains in any Spiderman movie…  "
" i would just like to give all of these spider-men a big hug. starting with andrew garfield, then tobey, then tom can get one too, and then, we’re finishing with the best for last — yep. you guessed it: andrew garfield again "
 i’m not even lying when i say i SOBBED when matt murdock showed up 
 I haven't seen it I just can't stand people having fun >:) 
"  “With great direction, came a great conclusion to the Home Trilogy!”Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) is a well made superhero movie directed by Jon Watts, and features Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jon Favreau, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Thomas Hayden Church, Jamie Foxx, Marisa Tomei, and Tony Revolori.Serving as a direct follow-up to Spider-Man; Far From Home, the sequel follows Peter Parker (Holland) attempting to seek support from Doctor Strange (Cumberbatch) to make a spell to…  "

But of course, the chip is broken, he loses control, and is corrupted by their untamed nature, which he is able to overcome by the end of the movie and sacrifice himself to fix his mistake. In THIS stupid movie, Peter fixes Doc Ock (and the rest of the Spidey villains) NOT by changing their hearts and minds or by…  "
"  9/10Well, that was surreal.I knew it was coming but it was still cool. Take away all the obvious fan service and I think you still got a very solid story. About Peter struggling to do what is right, trying to help the villains to the lengths that he does, realizing being Spider-Man sucks and is a lonely existence. I love how sad and depressing the ending is, he has no one and lives alone all for the sake…  "
" Imagine being MJ and meeting Andrew and realizing there was a cuter spiderman you could’ve seduced… is it still cheating if he’s also spiderman?I wasn’t into the first 30 minutes before any of the multiverse stuff happened because it was like “yeah, believe men!” but I thought the stuff with the other villains was cute and I LOVE spider-mandrew!! I laughed and squealed. I didn’t cry. When would you guys even cry? That’s weird. Aunt May should’ve died faster. "
  i’m still processing all of my thoughts with this movie and the many emotions i had during it. there’s movie was incredible and everything i dreamed it would be. just for the nostalgia alone this deserves 5 stars but so much more impacted me. tom holland as spider-man shines in this. he plays a perfect peter parker and it shows in this film especially. spider-man is my favorite male superhero and peter parker is my favorite character. there’s something so comforting…  
"  Still so fun. Breaking down walls. Worlds colliding. The first time Octavious shows up on the bridge it really gets the heart pumping. By the time Green Goblin shows up the whole movie feels stuck in high gear. It's awesome.I was glad to have recently watched the Andrew Garfield movies before going into this, it really tied the room together. I dug Electro's makeover. The CGI for both the Lizard and the Sandman were kinda bogus in my opinion.…  "
"  the absolute BEST live action spiderman movie to date!! I don't think anything will top the multiverse anytime soon but wow wow wow. my favourite bits include the greatest version of the infamous ""with great power"" line as it drives the point home most effectively given the context the line is used. rip milf may 😔 another thing that has already been said a million times is the chemistry between our 3 beloved peters is MAGNETIC on screen and was…  "
" “Peter three!!!”Just as effective and emotional the second time around which I find really rare for these kinds of action films. The Spideys’ natural chemistry together elevates the scenes of them just hanging around like friends, and the insane roster of villains really raises the stakes with an especially impressive showing from Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and even Jamie Foxx surprised.2021 Ranked🗓: https://boxd.it/b8ksU "
"  Sorry to all fans of “Spider-Boy.” This is the film where Tom Holland’s Peter Parker truly becomes “Spider-Man.” A crowd-pleasing and emotionally rewarding tale of loss, heroism, and legacy, this almost acts as an origin story for a superhero that I didn’t think needed one. But, man, am I glad that this exists. No Way Home is an absolute blast. I had so much fun. Of course, you have the classic villains returning. Sure, some of them aren’t so great…  "
"  You have a gift. You have power. And with great power, there must also come great responsibility. A love letter to Spider-Man films. Of course I cried.What a perfectly crafted piece of fan service. And beyond being a jaw-dropping experience, it combines a lot of what makes Spider-Man Spider-Man.Tom Holland's Spider-Man has learned (in and out of the screen) from the previous Spider-Men and as a result, this MCU Spidey is a well-rounded hero now.Heartbreaking and exciting.…  "

"  This film disgusts me in every way shape and form. It’s the perfect culmination of everything I hate about Marvel, slapped together in the most disrespectful way possible. The worst part of it is how they dealt with the villains. Having Peter’s big character “with great power comes great responsibility” moment be to whip up a little serum and jab it in them is not only asinine, but also goes against everything that makes the villains so compelling in past…  "

"  Originally Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was to release before No Way Home then we had the pandemic. There's a clear impact with reversing the order of the films.Thematically it would make sense that Doctor Strange would engage with America Chavez first. However, I think the writing covered the necessary plot points to make it work. A spell that nearly breaks reality to help Peter get into college. I don't blame Sorcerer Supreme Wong for not wanting…  "

Already knowing what was going to happen, I looked at many more details.

 I thought I was immune from the nostalgia bait machine but Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield showed up and I just went feral. The power of unlocking childhood memories knows no bounds. 
 was on a complete high because of andrew garfields spiderman and now im utterly devastated I LOVE YOU ALL PETER PARKER 
  Kızmayın ama bence çok fan-service bir film olmuş. Çok daha iyisi yapılabilecek bir filmin potansiyelini 13 yaş ve altı fanlar için heba etmişler. Yine bir sürü saçma ve gereksiz espriler mevcuttu. Bu espri işini bu kadar abartmaları hep saçma buluyorum. Winter Soldier filmini çıkartmış olan bir stüdyonun yeni çıkartacağı filmlerini de bu ciddiyette yapmasının daha iyi olacağını düşünüyorum. Filmde beğenmediğim bir sürü şey vardı ama bence en saçma olayı MCU'daki en güçlü karakterlerden biri olan Doctor Strange'i küçük düşürmeleriydi. Tamam…  
 i am so impressed wow. i cant stop thinking about the mirror dimension- so cool. and there’s no way they’re not connecting this to into the spider-verse because i know you all saw the parallels between the apartment/snow/comic book flash thing at the very end and i just can’t wait. 
"  This is a top rate Spider-Man joint. I would say it's as good as Spider-Man 2 and Into the Spiderverse. They are able to close off the story of Tom Holland's Parker while continuing and putting a bow on Tobey MacGuire and Andrew Garfield's stories. When you throw in five villains and Doctor Strange on top of that, the balancing act is very impressive.The layer underneath the multiverse fun is talking about that moment when you're young when you…  "

"  You know, I’m a scientist myself.This right here is my Saturday Morning Cartoon. A crossover episode for the ages. I think to reiterate, it’s important that this arc of Tom Holland is over for now. Teenager Spider-Man wanted to help all the villains be cured and obviously it leads to a climatic event. Bringing the three Spider-Man’s into our universe perfectly ties together the arcs that were left unsolved. Particularly, Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man has more whimsicality in this because…  "

  Finally! This movie was out for a whole month before I saddled up and committed to a week night to go see it in theatres. Miraculously I hadn’t heard a whisper about the plot or even a sniff of a spoiler. I guess the key to that is to live under a rock or avoid YouTube and social media. Saw it with kyler and he wasn’t a fan. Here are my thoughts:As far as super hero movies go the…

"  It’s worth pausing for a minute just to acknowledge what “Spider-Man: No Way Home” actually accomplishes. For all its well-documented faults, I still think the MCU is taken for granted in a way that occasionally undersells the ambition with which they handle their properties. For years, Spider-Man as a character has been mocked for getting repeatedly rebooted with new actors to the point where nobody was all that interested in whoever was in the costume anymore. It’s a major credit…  "
"  Spider-Man: No Way Home captures - more than any other MCU film to date - the marriage of the mundane and the fantastic that characterizes Marvel's version of New York City. At one point in the film, Dr. Strange (rudely!) demands Peter, M.J., and Ned ""Scooby-Do this shit"" from within the Sanctum Sanctorum's Undercroft. One hard cut later and the ominous sounding Undercroft is revealed as an average brownstone basement. On either side of that cut exist the two seemingly…  "

The first 1/3 or so just felt kind of childish or too playful to me. But maybe this was on purpose to show that things do get real in the world. Things definitely get real and stakes are raised. Andrew Garfield was…  "
"  For a film that could’ve been a lot messier it does its job as the event film of the year. Expectations were not exceeded but at least met, and Tom Holland shines even with all the commotion around him. Pros:- The greatest performance Tom Holland has offered playing Spider-Man yet. He is easily the best performer in the film and I can say that this is undoubtedly his movie. - Although I wouldn’t say the direction was anything special,…  "

" Spider-Man One becomes a loner. A.G.’s Spider-Man redeemed. Spider-Man Two is a boss. The character arcs of the Spider-Men is what makes this film. Loved it. Dafoe rocks. All the above overcomes the movie’s contrived “MCU-ness”, e.g. plot, Dr. Strange magic logic, fan service, etc. "

"  It’s irreplaceable what the MCU does, and the stories they create, and Spider-Man is nothing but a product of that. With this Homecoming Trilogy coming to a close it seems almost mandatory to send it off with one bigger and better then the past two.

"  Primeiramente, me parece como uma desonesta mea culpa da Marvel/Disney pelos erros e desacertos que cometeu com o Homem-Aranha enquanto procura canonizar aqueles filmes que, durante um tempo, foram rechaçados e desprezados por eles e pelos ""críticos""; não podiam mais virar a cara para o apreço que os fãs do super-herói tinham especialmente por Maguire e, de forma mais singela -- e mais extasiante do que por Tom Holland --, por Garfield.

  SPOILER REVIEWSeriously guys this is gonna spoil the whole movieLast warning.Ok here we go:I really only have the energy to write about Tobey and Andrew’s stuff as well as the emotional side of the film as I’m too tired and it’s now 1:36am and I just got home since public transport in Sydney City is garbage. My favourite part of the film by far is the dynamic between all 3 Spidermen. I genuinely am struggling to…  
"  Let’s talk about nostalgic happiness and this film. More specifically, why there are people so adamantly against people enjoying things that they can’t vibe with that it sets off something in their brain to see people that sob watching this film (like me) as less intelligent, less cultured, less artistic, and see that their mission for the next 2 weeks is to retweet and like endless tweets from their fellow unappreciatiors. People from general audiences and people within Hollywood itself.…  "
"  Best part of this viewing was seeing it with my dad who not only had no idea about Tobey and Andrew, but no idea about any of the villains either. So that was a blast seeing it with him, it felt like my first time. So here’s the deal. I’ve seen this movie 4 times now, everyone knows I love it. So I want to point out some flaws, and if you have an answer, PLEASE comment below.1. Why…  "
 willem dafoe and andrew garfield you will always be famous! 
  So many regular MCU problems in this film. Everything happens and resolves in such a boring and anticlimactic way. I didn’t care at all for Andrews villains because they weren’t well developed in their own movies sadly. But all of Tobeys villains were as fantastic as they were years ago. Watching this made me realise how great the Sam Rami trilogy is- despite 3 having issues. These films felt dark and had interesting developed villain character moments. Sadly something we…  
"  ""Let's cure that ass!""I remember seeing the very first Sam Raimi Spiderman movie with Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe in the very theatre that I saw this in. Everything feels like its come full circle. No Way Home is the best movie in Jon Watts' Spiderman trilogy. It's also top-tier Spiderman, top-tier MCU, and well worth the high score its getting on Letterboxd!They nailed the humor, the storytelling, and the acting in this. I cannot believe that Willem…  "
"  Going into this film, I was incredibly nervous and expected it would be an incredibly entertaining movie, but far from great. The trailers had some cool moments, but it really seemed like the story of the film was a mess, the concept of the multiverse opening because Peter was being stupid in a spell just didn't sound very compelling to me and I thought it looked like they were focusing more on the fanservice than creating a good story, but…  "
" It feels silly to complain about the nostalgic bits feeling overpowering in a bad way because like duh, what did I expect, but most of them just exhausted me. A few moments are quite nice but for the most part, they read as very corporate and way too knowing. Has some of the most baffling moments of plotting which stretch past being dramatically compelling and just frustrate. Garfield looking good though, gimme a slice of that lasagna "

" They did one horrendous job at keeping all those secrets.Despite it all amounting to a surprisingly beautiful consolation scene and doing a rather decent, respectful job at differentiating the three generations (until they’re all MCU-pilled) and providing them with some welcome closure and character growth, every unspoilable twist in blockbusters now is “who’s that Pokémon”, nearly every joke in superhero movies now (but 98% this one) is “your powers come from where now? Uhhhhhh, that happened!” and how I wish I hadn’t been through enough of it all to feel the opposite of how everyone else was reacting when Guess Who showed up. "
  A film that's drenched in Cgi and Thrives on the already established nostalgia is bound to make you emotional when you see the familiar faces. But on an individual level No Way Home does nothing different. It's hollowness is even exemplified when you realize that neither of the main characters in the film can evoke a sense of belonging or create a tense situation. The film however becomes way more interesting when we get the obvious communion of the Spidermen…

"  It was entertaining. Obviously. And it drowns it's own carefully crafted corporate fun juice. Something so sweet that burns your throat. But everybody seems to be pretty numb to it. The movie did not want to take itself seriously for a single moment. The only good scene was when the goblin was awakened and gave that whole speech and things actually got interesting. But Even May's death was treated as a cheap emotional gateway from all the ""let's all cure…  "

He's so good in this. I just feel like we really…

  I went into this film being skeptical and thinking they were not going to pull this off and I was fortunately wrong (for the most part). Seeing all the previous villains and Spider-Mans coming back was great. I was so happy when  Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire appeared on screen. They did service to both Dr. Octavious and The Green Goblin and both had great arcs. Willem Dafoe performance was so good.

 dude it was so good. literally so sick. go see it rn. worth all the hype and praise. great villains and great twists and reveals ( even if they were leaked ) still so iconic. theater erupted several times and i was there for it. Andrew’s STILL goated. 
 my spidermen ❤💙🖤🕸 :')this is literally the only movie that exists right now nobody talk to me about any other movies idk them and idc ✋🏼 
"  “Peter, Peter, Peter…no good deed goes unpunished.”Worst theater experience I’ve had this year. Had a family of idiots that were hacking with nasty phlegmy coughs. They brought a gigantic Walmart bag of candies with soda cans and they  always made sure they made anytime they opened a bag that it was the loudest noise in the room. Not to mention their kid playing Among Us while the film was going on. Or the fact that the dad of the…  "
  - Review in a bit but for now I’ll just say sweet baby Jesus this is incredible.- Here’s that review.- There’s no way something like this should ever exist. These characters should never interact together in the same universe as each other it should never of happened but it did.- There’s a reason Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors and Green Goblin is my favorite Spider-Man villain and one of my favorite villains of all…  
"  This was the pinnacle of Spider-man movies (to me). I rented a theater for this for me and about 52 friends and with the exception of one person we all loved it but there is so much to unpack. This movie opens so many doors and also closes so many. The Action, Comedy, nostalgia, and pain where all apparent. I intend to respect the no spoilers request of the studio but thr film never seems slow. It always makes you…  "
"  okay… i waited my whole life for this moment since i became a spider-man fan so… literally INSANE the feeling that this single film broadcast to me, spider-man has always been in my life since childhood and  the importance of this single character to me, is HUGE. watch happen what happened in this movie was wonderful, i kept shivering during the session just bc i knew that andrew garfield and tobey maguire were going to be there (probably marvel's best fan servise). the movie works SO GOOD…  "
 How I felt when Tobey showed up is probably how everyone else felt when Cap wielded Thor's hammer in Endgame

"  “I love you guys!”WHAT A RIDEEEE. THAT was my best cinematic experience. The audience went completely insane. I still can’t believe my favorite Spidey (Andrew’s) made a comeback! Seeing those 3 versions of Peter Parker in one screen feels like a dream. I’m really glad the 3 of them got along well and had a great chemistry, it made the movie better & funnier. My absolute favorite moment of the movie was when the Spider-Mans did their iconic landing poses…  "
 I have honestly never heard a reaction like the SCREAM that erupted in the cinema when andrews spidey appeared and it made my andrew garfield/the amazing spiderman loving heart so happy 🥰

"  Kind of an unfortunate tug of war between genuinely a heartfelt Peter Parker / Spider-Man story and dumbass point at the screen and clap fan-service. This is the epitome of what Martin Scorsese was saying when he called Marvel films ""theme park attractions"" (actually maybe the avengers movies are more so, but I'm not watching them). Like I dunno if I really enjoyed this all that much. It's lower case f 'fine', like all Marvel movies. But doesn't really feel…  "

  Spider-Man: No Way Home is not perfect. It's not one of the greatest films of all time. It's a film with many pros and many cons:PROS:• Actually I was on board from the get go. Love the exciting tense intro. Love the music.• DAREDEVIL.• Seeing the villains again is awesome. Especially Doc Ock and Goblin. Willem Dafoe as always is brilliantly eerie and is given the most time to shine with his villainy.• The film…  
"  Any fears that I wouldn't love this were immediately dispelled by the Talking Heads needle drop during the first five minutes.Sure, it's handled a little clumsily in places, the setpieces were somewhat disappointing and it suffers from some of that standardised-feeling weightlessness prevalent within the MCU at this point, but to bring together these universes in a way that is (mostly) cohesive, comedically effective and emotionally satisfying to a long term Spider-Man fan is no mean feat. It also…  "

"  Bayıldım!! Spider-Man manyağı olan benim için bu filmin değeri çok çok büyük. Tüm istediklerimizi bize sunmuşlar bu sebeple olumsuz tek bir yorumda bulunamam. Resmen gözlere şenlik! Üç Spider-Man’i ve tüm kötü karakterleri ekranda beraber görmek deli işi gibiydi resmen. Diğerlerinin de filmde yer alacağından çok emindim ama yinede filme dahil oldukları anda şaşkınlığımı ve heyecanımı zor korudum denebilir :’)Andrew Garfield’a çıldırdııımm!!!

 Peter Parker telling Peter Parker in front of Peter Parker that Peter Parker is amazing and should never think he’s anything less was the peak of cinematic entertainment. 
"  “You know, I’m something of a scientist myself.”Man this movie is just gonna keep getting better and better. Marvel and Sony pulled off something truly special. I can tell this one will be getting rewatched a lot. With all the awesome action and fan service, the focus is still on Peter the entire time and I love the direction they are taking him now. When Tobey and Andrew show up I still screamed even knowing they were coming.WE…  "

"  My first trip back to the theater since Feb 2020. I have to admit, I had a mild panic attack when I first got there. Ugh. Anxiety sucks. 26 minutes of previews?! Shoot me. Also, teenagers talked about unrelated social media gossip the ENTIRE movie despite my efforts to silence them. The movie was good. It was pretty cheesy and downright bad in spots. The beginning was actually kind of stupid and the tone was really off, but the Dr.…  "

Before it’s release I really thought that it was gonna be a letdown. It ended up being outstanding.I only have one big flaw with this movie, and that it one of the themes it tries to show.

" It’s just a tree, man. Just a tree.Kinda wonder if the Christmas setting at the end is intentionally reflective of the fact that it plays out like a spin on It’s A Wonderful Life where George Bailey’s wish was born from genuine heroism rather than selfish despair… anyhow, easily top three Spider-Man movies for me. The condo fight is one of my favorite set pieces in any Marvel movie. "

"  Tom Holland really turned William Dafoe into William Dafriend :)Gave me everything I wanted and more. Gives a whole new level of vulnerability to Holland's Spider-Man that I was craving. It relies heavily, and I mean HEAVILY on nestolgia and fan-service but in a way that actually doesn't feel cheap like I was expecting. Toby stepping out of that portal for the first time had me holding back tears. I can't tell you just how hard I've been feeling…  "
  Yaaaaas finally able to get back to the theatre 🎭 saw this with my partner this afternoon in 3D-DOX !! Was her choice out of the double feature film we saw today!! So first off these types of films aren’t my forte but nonetheless I always have an open mind to enjoy these types of films !! So it started out rather well & I was really loving it then all the old villains popping up was very exciting and all…  
"  “For the fans” but then what the hell isn’t these days? That said, I think Garfield is genuinely fantastic in this. It’s as if he’s internalized the disappointment of being a failed Spider-Man–in both the textual and metatextual sense–and can barely conceal his need for validation, like a seal bouncing a ball on its nose. It’s unwavering positivity attempting to compensate for self-doubt and shame (which again, the film is very much encouraging the viewer to read as self-commentary on…  "

  Hype is finally over. December 17 was the day where the impossible happened. Thank you Kevin Fiege. Thank you Sam Raimi. Thank you Marvel. All of you made the impossible happen to people who really needed it.Sitting down in the theater I felt like a kid again. Seeing the old villains come back after almost 20 years made me realize how much time has passed since I would watch Spider-Man (2002) on repeat back in the day. It’s what…  
 andrew garfield seyit onbaşının çanakkale cephesinde sırtında taşıdığı mermi gibi sırtlanmış filmi helal olsun aslanıma 
 Coming to terms with the fact that Andrew Garfield is my favorite one 
" This was fun! The usage of the multiverse villains and heroes could’ve led to some extremely ham-fisted moments (and there are a few let’s be real) but overall it was handled far more maturely than I expected. Tom Holland really killed it here, and by the end you can tell he’s surely a definitive Spider-Man. It’s really not a masterpiece like everyone is making it out to be, some of the filmmaking choices particularly felt very uninspired, but it could’ve been a lot worse. "

Every scene in this film felt surreal, like a dream, and everyone in the cinema was watching something completely different.
