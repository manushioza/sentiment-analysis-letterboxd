  Hello Peter. Rating hasn't changed. Now the time has come to talk about spoilers about 'Spider-Man: No way home' as this is my third time watching this..... I can't get over the way that this film actually exists and it works as well. The film manages to balance the problems that Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' and Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 3' had to overcome - having way too many characters to fight for screen time while focusing on how‚Ä¶  
"  Coming to Spider-Man: No Way Home for the first time in early February is quite the experience. I did my best to avoid spoilers, but after about a week people generally stopped caring about trying to be coy.

"  Spider-Man: No Way Home works better as individual scenes than it does as a whole. If you look at the big picture, everything it supposedly achieves starts coming apart at the seams because‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not much. Everything it is and does, it owes to the previous live-action iterations of Spider-Man. Its big emotional swings come from villains fought by other universes‚Äô Spider-Men and its moments of relief come from reminiscing over transformative experiences we‚Äôve already witnessed. The purpose of it‚Ä¶  "

"  The cynic in me doesn‚Äôt want to go this high in rating, because ultimately I do have issues with it. You can't compare a movie like this to an art house film, so take the rating knowing it‚Äôs simply because the experience I got from injecting this drug of a film into my veins, and the dopamine released during that high, was unlike anything I‚Äôve seen in a long time.¬†First of all, spoilers ahead.

"  Now that everyone has mostly seen the movie already, it's finally time for me to talk about this movie with more specific details. The MCU Spider-Man has been a mixed bag to be honest. I mean, I really liked what the Russo Brothers did with him in the Avengers movies, but his stand-alone titles just never connected with me. Homecoming was fine, and Far From Home felt like a filler storyline (besides the post credits scene). Tom Holland‚Äôs great in‚Ä¶  "

  One good look around and yup I'm definitely in the minority here. I'll start with some positives! Willem Dafoe is a powerhouse I mean god he gave it 100%. His confrontations with Spider-Man are so savage and makes for probably the best emotional/action moments in the entire film. The action in general was fantastic. Whether it was the hand to hand or magical fights (Dr. Strange was awesome gg Cumberbatch) they were all exhilarating. Holland himself gives his best Spider-Man‚Ä¶

 After watching it for a second time I can definitely say it is one of the best film I have watched. They managed to bring all these characters back from the older films without ruining their legacies and managed to give Tobey maguire and Andrew Garfield a lot of screen time without taking the focus of the film away from Tom Holland. Willem Dafoe was amazing with one of the best performances I've seen in a comic book movie.

"  It‚Äôs worth pausing for a minute just to acknowledge what ‚ÄúSpider-Man: No Way Home‚Äù actually accomplishes. For all its well-documented faults, I still think the MCU is taken for granted in a way that occasionally undersells the ambition with which they handle their properties.

  Spider-Man: No Way Home is not perfect. It's not one of the greatest films of all time. It's a film with many pros and many cons:PROS:‚Ä¢ Actually I was on board from the get go.

"  Any fears that I wouldn't love this were immediately dispelled by the Talking Heads needle drop during the first five minutes.Sure, it's handled a little clumsily in places, the setpieces were somewhat disappointing and it suffers from some of that standardised-feeling weightlessness prevalent within the MCU at this point, but to bring together these universes in a way that is (mostly) cohesive, comedically effective and emotionally satisfying to a long term Spider-Man fan is no mean feat.

The usage of the multiverse villains and heroes could‚Äôve led to some extremely ham-fisted moments (and there are a few let‚Äôs be real) but overall it was handled far more maturely than I expected. Tom Holland really killed it here, and by the end you can tell he‚Äôs surely a definitive Spider-Man.

"  No Way Home feels very much like the filmmakers were constantly asking, ‚ÄúWhat will Spider-Man fans really love?‚Äù and then did that.

  One good look around and yup I'm definitely in the minority here. I'll start with some positives! Willem Dafoe is a powerhouse I mean god he gave it 100%. His confrontations with Spider-Man are so savage and makes for probably the best emotional/action moments in the entire film. The action in general was fantastic.

 After watching it for a second time I can definitely say it is one of the best film I have watched. They managed to bring all these characters back from the older films without ruining their legacies and managed to give Tobey maguire and Andrew Garfield a lot of screen time without taking the focus of the film away from Tom Holland. Willem Dafoe was amazing with one of the best performances I've seen in a comic book movie.

We got so much more of Maguire and Garfield than most of us expected. I felt so appreciated to have cameos that were more of supporting characters than bit parts. I was blown away by the performances, the story, the visuals, everything. So refreshing. "

  Just in case Letterboxd doesn't make it clear: THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.[IMAX at the AMC Alderwood 16]I should love this movie because it's like the screenwriters designed this climactic episode to address my primary objections to most superhero stories: It stresses responsibility ‚Äî a theme I've always appreciated in Spidey-tales ‚Äî¬†and it takes a higher road than usual: It refuses to satiate the audience's appetite for climactic executions. It's focused more on loving enemies than eliminating them. Hell‚Ä¶

  THIS IS MY SPOILER REVIEW- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE LEAVE!!!I can't believe they were in it. It was a surreal experience when they walked through those portals. The cheers were comparable to a football match. They didn't waste them either.

  A film that's drenched in Cgi and Thrives on the already established nostalgia is bound to make you emotional when you see the familiar faces.

  God Damn this is the best spider-man iv ever seen. I just want to gush all over this movie. Tom holland is the best spider-man we could ever ask forZendaya is the most believable Mj we could ask forCumberbongs as Dr strange is just 100% match made in heavenned isnt as annoying as he usually is.. not sure what happened thereGreen Goblin: they made him interesting and weird and insane and chaotic - Dafoe - you‚Ä¶  
"  Too tired to write an actual review so here's some sporadic thoughts: - Tom Holland is a good actor. I don't care for his choices in picking roles, but he always brings it.- Most of the action scenes look like wet concrete, which I'm sorry but is pretty unforgivable when these things cost 200 million dollars.- I like Zendaya but her MJ ain't got shit on Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone.- Andrew Garfield and Willem Dafoe are‚Ä¶  "

 Benedict Cumberbatch Movie 3/3¬†I like Andrew Garfield 
  It‚Äôs what we do.¬†I think this really might be the best live-action Spidey movie. It just has so much heart and respect for the character in all of his iterations. Maguire and Garfield are used so well to help complement Holland‚Äôs arc. It was so cool to see them offer him guidance and perspective on being Spider-Man instead of just being used as fan service.

This movie is the best example of the terrible hype cycle and everything I don‚Äôt like about marvel.

"  Now THIS was a Spider-Man film.In 2018, I hated Far From Home so much that I refused to watch another MCU project. Unfortunately I am a Spider-Man fan first and MCU hater second so I had to break that rule and go see this opening night and OH BOY WAS THAT THE RIGHT CALL.This is now MCU Spider-Man 1.

"  Spoiler thoughts,1-So, Doctor Strange is no longer the sorcerer supreme. Wong is. Which makes Shang Chi make more sense, (Shang Chi spoilers ahead) as Wong was the one to go after the ten rings in the credit scene, which duties like these are Strange's (The credit scene with strange and Thor) 2- This isn't the first time that Marvel does the ""we are doing too many things in one film but will make it work"" thing, they did it‚Ä¶  "
"  I decided to watch Spider-Man No Way Home: The More Fun Stuff Edition which adds another 11 minutes to the theatrical cut.

"  Just going to chain gun this one out. Watts is spinning a lot of plates with this one. Too bad most of them fall to the floor and shatter into a million pieces, much like Manhattan does in the mirror dimension. No Way Home garners great success via the performances of Holland, Zendaya, and Dafoe, and through the handling of Aunt May's death.

 Cried laugh horny for Andrew Garfield 
" Interactions between the three Spider+Men pretty much sum this up: Maguire and Garfield are great together (some of Maguire's best work here, even) and Holland is a total dud; still not sold on him at all. Definite course correction at play for the character, though.Liked it better than I expected but I wouldn't pay for this probably.MCU Peter Parker the second worst Parker after Santonio. "
"  Today was a good day and this was like a dream come true for a Spider-man fan like myself. I couldn't believe that I was actually watching the film because everyone had talked theories but I had avoided spoilers until I could see it.

  - Review in a bit but for now I‚Äôll just say sweet baby Jesus this is incredible.- Here‚Äôs that review.- There‚Äôs no way something like this should ever exist.

  Spider-Man: No Way Home is not perfect. It's not one of the greatest films of all time. It's a film with many pros and many cons:PROS:‚Ä¢ Actually I was on board from the get go. Love the exciting tense intro. Love the music.‚Ä¢ DAREDEVIL.‚Ä¢ Seeing the villains again is awesome. Especially Doc Ock and Goblin.

"  Any fears that I wouldn't love this were immediately dispelled by the Talking Heads needle drop during the first five minutes.Sure, it's handled a little clumsily in places, the setpieces were somewhat disappointing and it suffers from some of that standardised-feeling weightlessness prevalent within the MCU at this point, but to bring together these universes in a way that is (mostly) cohesive, comedically effective and emotionally satisfying to a long term Spider-Man fan is no mean feat.

The usage of the multiverse villains and heroes could‚Äôve led to some extremely ham-fisted moments (and there are a few let‚Äôs be real) but overall it was handled far more maturely than I expected. Tom Holland really killed it here, and by the end you can tell he‚Äôs surely a definitive Spider-Man.
